# Python Basic Encrypt Program With Keys
## What it does?
This program can encrypt texts by using different keys. 
Also, with encrypted text and true key it can decrypt texts.
## How it works?
Program has a realy simple algorithm, firstly randomly generates a 10 number key (or takes from user) and it shuffles the given text according to the this key.
## How to use?
Just follow the messages:
### Encryption process:
- Enter 1 for encryt a text (or a text file)
- After write your message (or a text file name)
- Then create a key (enter 1 for a randomly generated key, enter 2 for give key with your hand)
- If you are in password_from_file.py, randomly generated key will be saved in keys.txt file
- Enter 3 for exit
### Decryption Process:
- Enter 2 for decrypt a text (or a text file)
- Enter key (This key must be the using key while the encryption process)
- Enter 3 for exit
#### If you are in password_from_file.py also you have to enter file names.
